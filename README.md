# ERP-Output-Cleaner

This script is capable of recognizing the following outputs from our ERP system:

- Inventory stock
- Price history
- Inbound and outbound item movements
- Item card
- Accounting history
- Supplier list
- Customer list

The recognition of the general ledger export is currently under development.

The script properly converts the listed outputs and standardizes the dates to the Italian format (dd/mm/yyyy). It allows the creation of Excel files that can be used by company employees for analysis or processing of this data, or provides updated data sources for the custom Excel applications I have developed.
